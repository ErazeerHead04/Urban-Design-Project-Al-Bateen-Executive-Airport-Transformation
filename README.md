# Beyond Bigness: A Green, Walkable Future for Al Bateen

## Overview

This project proposes a transformative redevelopment of the Al Bateen Executive Airport site in Abu Dhabi into a vibrant, inclusive, and green mixed-use neighborhood. The project challenges the dominant paradigm of large-scale, car-oriented, and elite-focused development in the Gulf region, advocating instead for human-scale urbanism rooted in sustainability, walkability, and spatial justice.

## Project Vision

The proposal reimagines the underutilized 200-hectare Al Bateen Airport as a public asset that serves the broader community rather than a privileged few. Central to the vision is the replacement of the existing 3.2 km runway with a continuous green promenade and the establishment of a fine-grain pedestrian-friendly grid.

### Key Features:
- **Mixed-use and mixed-income development** with 30% affordable housing
- **Walkable urban fabric** with 2-minute traversable blocks and shaded arcades
- **Green infrastructure** including tree-lined streets, courtyards, bioswales, and permeable paving
- **Mobility-oriented design** with car-free zones, bike lanes, transit corridors, and underground parking
- **Participatory planning** that emphasizes flexibility, inclusivity, and local culture

## Urban Design Philosophy

Inspired by the works of:
- **Henri Lefebvre** (Right to the City, Differential Space)
- **Jane Jacobs** (Sidewalk Ballet, Dark Age Ahead)
- **David Sim** (Soft City)
- **Richard Sennett** (Infrastructures of Disorder)
- **Jan Gehl** (Life Between Buildings)

The proposal emphasizes:
- **Human-scale development**
- **Multifunctional, flexible ground-level use**
- **Social equity through inclusive zoning**
- **Cultural continuity through contextual architecture**

## Comparative Precedents

The project draws lessons from international case studies, including:
- **Mueller Airport Redevelopment** in Austin, Texas
- **Downsview Redevelopment** in Toronto, Canada

These examples demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of transforming obsolete infrastructure into sustainable, livable neighborhoods.

## Governance & Implementation

- Formation of a **multi-stakeholder development authority**
- Institutional mechanisms for **community participation**, **ongoing evaluation**, and **adaptive planning**
- Policies such as **inclusionary zoning**, **rent caps**, and **support for cooperative housing** to ensure long-term affordability

## Environmental & Social Impact

- Mitigates **urban heat island effects** with climate-responsive design
- Improves **mobility equity**, especially for women, children, and the elderly
- Reinforces **social cohesion** through accessible public spaces and shared amenities
